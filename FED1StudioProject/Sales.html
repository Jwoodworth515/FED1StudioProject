                <p1 class="employeeText">
                    As a determined and young girl Josie had everything, she needed to prepare herself for the world of Sales when she received her first quarter at a Lemonade stand, she had outside of her house.  Graduating with honors from Kansas University in 2015 she has joined many sales teams and always worked her way to the top.  Her actions are always on point and quick to the draw and when she met Green Thumb Academy at a lead generation convention in Las Vegas, she did not disappoint the staff on hand.  Her knowledge and expertise were exactly what Green Thumb needed to grow and expand their market. Much like she did in the past, in just a few years’ time she climbed the ranks of the sales staff at GTA and now directs all client and customer facing business.  In her free time, she likes to travel to the mountains and never misses an opportunity to ski.

                    <p1 class="employeeText">
                        Jane is a city girl with a warm personality until you tell her she cannot do something; she will prove you wrong every time.  With no formal training, Jane is what you call a natural at bending clients and customers a-like to her will.  At a young age Jane took over the family business, a general store in her hometown of Spokane Washington.  The store itself was a mainstay in town and had never shown growth until Jane took over the reins.  The Allen's general store was modified and replicated now multiple times in three of the surrounding states proudly holding her family’s name.  The original store serves as an office for Jane who never wants to leave her hometown.  As a member of Green Thumb Academy, she has overseen the growth and expansion from a single class to multiple classes in multiple locations in the region.

                            Instead of waiting for the "good leads" Leonard is a master of turning something out of nothing.  Building castles with a grain of sand and knocking down the competition’s is his m.o.  Working in a team environment Leonard shines with his upbeat outlook on life and never-ending perseverance to push his coworkers to their fullest potential.  He has been known to pitch the anyone that he meets on a potential new avenue of thought, which is why a few of the people he has spoken to are now part of the team.  Recruitment was never a requirement of his position at Green Thumb Academy, but it is an unmistakable talent that he possess.  In his free time (when he is not making sales to anyone that will listen to him) he is raising his family in the suburbs of Kansas City and teaching his junior to aspire to his talents.
