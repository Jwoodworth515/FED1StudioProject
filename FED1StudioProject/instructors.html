                    With a background in horticulture from Boise State University and operating her families Nursery in Idaho from a young age; Betsy brings a wealth of knowledge to the Green Thumb team.  Idaho is known for rough agricultural climates and uncertain extreme changes in the weather.  She is the first to show up for class and the last to leave and somehow never skips a beat.  She sometimes gets a little out of hand when working with dirt and has been known to start dirt fights with the support staff.  If you have a question, she most likely has an answer for you when it comes to gardening.  A human index of gardening knowledge and is always willing to listen and help.  In her spare time, Betsy loves to volunteer her time at community gardens and helping high-school level educators teach their students the importance of gardening.

                    With his welcoming disposition and willingness to help others succeed, Josiah spent his youth backpacking the country.  Every company has an employee that thinks it should be Hawaiian shirt day every day and Green Thumb's version is Josiah.  The office prankster and the one you must look out for if he is quiet.  When he is not pranking the GT staff, he is teaching all levels of the classes that Green Thumb offers with a base knowledge of each subject.  Years of backpacking has made him a sponge when it comes to picking up new things and being able to excel at them.  While only a member of the team for a couple of years, Josiah has assumed most the responsibilities of a veteran instructor.  With his innovative outlook on gardening, he is known for teaching the other teachers something new every day.

                <p1 class="employeeText">
                    Naomi is the Green Thumb Academy Index and Reference Library.  She just seems to have knowledge of every aspect of gardening and loves to teach others.  Students usually enjoy her classes because of just how informative she is.  With her gift for gardening, she loves to can her own harvest and is hoping to one day open her own line of craft salsa's and pickle's.  Naomi usually teaches the advanced classes at Green Thumb but sometimes jumps in to cover the "green" students as a mentor.  What staff does not need a mentor to mentor their own staff, Naomi handles that as well in stride.  She is responsible for the Green Thumb Academy learning structure and curriculum.  In her spare time Naomi like to memorize the various Latin names of plants and volunteers her time at the Zoo helping the staff cultivate exotic foods for the animals.
