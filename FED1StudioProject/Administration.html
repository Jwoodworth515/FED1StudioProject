                    Heading up the daily grind of operations and all the challenges that come with its Kennedy takes them in stride.  Building a team of teachers, salesman, and always finding the solution for every hurdle.  It is no surprise that she ran track in high-school and tried out for the Olympic team trials at her first opportunity.  Hurdles are nothing new to Green Thumb Academy and they have never been handled quite the same way as after joined the team.  Delegating on a whole other level is what makes business run efficiently and it is her calling.  A modest person, Kennedy likes to keep to herself in her free time, opting for a book and cup of coffee over nightlife.  She is currently engaged and enthusiastic of starting her new family.  Coming from a large family herself, it probably comes easy to solve large problems with multiple people.

                    A native of San Francisco Lin has always enjoyed being part of a team.  The ra ra nature of his personality no doubt comes from his sporting background.  It was there at Oregon State, while studying sports medicine that Lin decided that he wanted to be part of something that helped people learn to sustain themselves.  Green Thumb Academy team member Leonard had met Lin on an online forum and had persuaded Lin to visit Kansas City and their operation.  Even though he had no prior education in Business operations, the structure of was familiar in the sense of being a part of a team.  It was not long before Lin changed career paths and was added to the Green Thumb family.  Lin is responsible for keeping the wheels greased and everyone happy on the staff.  He can commonly be seen enjoying a sporting event in the area and always is ready for sports trivia.

                    A life-long public servant Lucian has always been the type of guy that is there for you.  When his brother and himself were separated from their family on a hiking trip, Lucian was able to recall survival books that he had read and was able to traverse the trails back to their family.  No small feat for an 8-year-old in Rockies surviving for 5 days with minimal supplies.  Lucian brings that creative problem solving and instinct to act quickly to Green Thumb Academy.  He is always ready and prepared for what each new days brings as part of the support staff.  When it is raining outside, he is still smiling and cheering up his coworkers cracking jokes and bringing the sunlight into the room.  Every staff needs a Lucian and Green Thumb is made better every single day with his presence and guidance.
