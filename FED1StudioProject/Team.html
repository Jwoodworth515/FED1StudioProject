                <p1 class="employeeText">
                    A 26-year-old business professional and transplant from San Diego.  After receiving his honors from Arizona State, Federico took a few years to gather his thoughts and traveled the world while finding himself.  Along the way he was able to join a few startups before creating his first business Green Thumb Academy.  Now, as the owner of multiple companies including Green Thumb Academy, he prides himself on the colorful and exciting young team of professionals that push his enterprises day in and day out. With a love for gardening and providing for his own family he found a niche that would later become the Green Thumb Academy to help others replicate what he had learned.  It is not uncommon to see Federico with his hands just as dirty as his staff, a real leader by example.

                    A 24-year-old business professional that studied with Federico at Arizona State and majored in Business Relations and Botany.

Since joining the team at Green Thumb Academy, she has transformed the aesthetic and culture of the company to reflect her bubbly and personality.  With a knack for personal gardening at her family’s home when growing up has led her right back to her roots.  In Margie's spare time she enjoys concerts and as a foody, every new restaurant in town.

                    Finding his path has been a difficult one and it is by no mistake he is a part of the team at Green Thumb Academy.  Starting his own companies with marginal success Milo has always been willing to lend a helping hand.  He spent a few years with the Peace Corps building homes in less than fortunate 3rd world countries and helping their communities learn to grow and store their own food supplies.  With years of helping others build their businesses he brings his life experiences and expertise with him.  He dreams of one day opening his own chain of full-service car wash chains in the greater Kansas City area where he grew up.
